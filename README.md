# Installation
Create and activate virtual environment.

```bash
python -m venv .
Scripts\activate
```

Install the packages using `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In `config.py` change your credentials etc.\
Also, since it's currently in development, you'll need to manually add your devices in `main.py` and customize it to your needs (see disclaimer at the bottom).

# Usage
Run it directly.

```bash
python main.py
```

# Disclaimer
I made this for my own usage, uploaded because many people wanted to see the source code.
